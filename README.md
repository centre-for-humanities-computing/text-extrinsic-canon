###

This repository contains code for embeddings, plots and results of our paper: 

"Why Novels (Don't) Break Through: Dynamics of Canonicity in the Danish Modern Breakthrough (1870-1900)" which was presented at LaTeCH-CLfL at NAACL 2025.

## Useful directions üìå

Some useful directions:
- `text-extrinsic-canon/` the main folder contains the Python files to get the results
- `/data/` contains saved embeddings (.json) used for the analysis
- `/figs/` contains the figures generated by the notebooks
- `/latex_tables/` contains code for the LaTeX tables in the paper
- `/notebooks/` contains the notebooks used for the analysis
- `/results/` contains results of the experiments


## Data & paper üìù

The dataset used is available at [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/chcaa/memo-canonical-novels), which is an updated version of the original [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MiMe-MeMo/Corpus-v1.1).

Please cite our [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2025.latechclfl-1.25/) if you use the code or the embeddings:
